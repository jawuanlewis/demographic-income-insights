## ðŸ“œ Project Description

Creating a collection of visualizations to analyze data from the United States Census Bureau. The goal is to uncover demographic patterns that predict whether an individual earns above or below \$50,000 annually. These insights can support university marketing teams in crafting targeted outreach strategies.

**Note:** This project is inspired by a data visualization course (CSE 578) with Arizona State University.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the analysis locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jawuanlewis/demographic-income-insights.git
cd demographic-income-insights

# 2. Create & activate a venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## ðŸ—ƒ Data & Cleaning

1. Raw data lives in `data/adult.data` (contains 32,000+ samples of the U.S. population, and their demographic data).

2. Missing values (?) are replaced with the column mode.

3. To regenerate the cleaned dataset (CSV), run:

```bash
python3 clean_dataset.py
```

This produces `data/cleaned_census_data.csv`, which all notebooks consume.


## ðŸ“’ Notebooks & Usage

Each notebook corresponds to a unique user story for universities to leverage when marketing degree programs.

To explore the analyses:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

- Open any notebook in the `notebooks` folder and run cells top-to-bottom.
- Each notebook contains brief story details and a chart (Matplotlib/Seaborn)


## ðŸ”® Next Steps

- Add geographic or time-series visualizations

- Compare alternative imputation methods

- Build a predictive model (logistic regression, tree-based)

- Package insights in an interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit)
